# Data-Project-1

For this project, we sought to examine how Google search data for trends could be predictive of health and health behaviors around Covid. Our first question  aimed to determine if there is a relationship between Google searches for common Covid symptoms and surges in Covid cases. From this question, we hope to gain insight on how search data could be used as a tool to predict surges in the case of future pan/epidemics. 

#Our second question aimed to examine if health behaviors matched with Google searches. We examined this relationship, first in a forward direction in which we examined Google searches for vaccination appointments and compared those searches to new persons vaccinated. We then examined this relationship in an inverted fashion, where we used a known event that likely affected the count of new persons vaccinated with a specific vaccine, then examined if searches for side effects would reflect this. 

#Our third question aimed to determine the short and long term mental health impacts of Covid19. This was achieved by examining search rates for mental health related conditions throughout different periods of the pandemic, including lock down, the pandemic generally, and post lockdown. These areas allow us to gain insight into if Google search is an effective public health tool that can be used in the healthcare industry as a form of intervention.

#We decided to approach the data by utilizing the same Covid-19 Case Dataset to ensure that we were all started with the same base. We selected this dataset because it was clean and localized to the US. We then chose the most appropriate dataset for each question from Googleâ€™s Covid-19 Open Data. From here we pulled Search Trends, Vaccinations, and Vaccination Search. These three dataset include search data on common medical symptoms, searches relating specifically to the Covid-19 vaccine, and vaccination counts per vaccine type available.
